This project is a **User Management System** built as part of the **Front-End Development class**. It demonstrates the use of **React Router**, **form handling with Formik**, and state management with React's Context API. The application allows users to navigate between pages, add new users, edit existing users, and delete users from a list. The project focuses on building a functional, responsive, and user-friendly UI.
